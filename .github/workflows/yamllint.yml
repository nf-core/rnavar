            ## YAML linting is failing

            To keep the code consistent with lots of contributors, we run automated code consistency checks.
            To fix this CI test, please run:

            * Install `yamllint`
                * Install `yamllint` following [this](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#installing-yamllint)
                instructions or alternative install it in your [conda environment](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/yamllint)
            * Fix the markdown errors
                * Run the test locally: `yamllint $(find . -type f -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml") -c ./.yamllint.yml`
                * Fix any reported errors in your YAML files

            Once you push these changes the test should pass, and you can hide this comment :+1:

            We highly recommend setting up yaml-lint in your code editor so that this formatting is done automatically on save. Ask about it on Slack for help!

            Thanks again for your contribution!
